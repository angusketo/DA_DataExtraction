# DA_DataExtraction
A series of Jupyter notebooks and instructions for extracting the dataset of Dielsâ€“Alder reactions used in [10.1021/jacs.4c03131].

The reactions are extracted in two notebooks: Reaxys_Data_Extraction.ipynb and DonatedIDs_Data_Acquisition.ipynb. The former should be run first and the latter second. The latter should be used for the IDs in donatedIDs.csv.

These reactions are then verified with Identify_RC_DA.ipynb.
